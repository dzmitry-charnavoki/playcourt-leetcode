___

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
___

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

    grid = [
      ["1","1","1","1","0"],
      ["1","1","0","1","0"],
      ["1","1","0","0","0"],
      ["0","0","0","0","0"]
    ]

**Output:** 1 

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

    grid = [
      ["1","1","0","0","0"],
      ["1","1","0","0","0"],
      ["0","0","1","0","0"],
      ["0","0","0","1","1"]
    ]

**Output:** 3 
___

**Constraints:**

*   `m == grid.length`
*   `n == grid[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 300`
*   `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.
