Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` _if_ `word` _exists in the grid_.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

*   `n = board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 6`
*   `1 <= word.length <= 15`
*   `board` and `word` consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.
