___

Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

**Note:** You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
___

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num1 = "2", num2 = "3"

**Output:** "6" 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num1 = "123", num2 = "456"

**Output:** "56088" 
___

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200`
*   `num1` and `num2` consist of digits only.
*   Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zero, except the number `0` itself.
