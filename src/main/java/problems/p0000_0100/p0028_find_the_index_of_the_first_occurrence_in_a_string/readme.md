<span style="color:#deb800">***Medium***</span>
___

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.
___

**Example 1:**

    Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
    The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

**Example 2:**

    Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
    Output: -1
    Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
___

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
* `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.
